# SecureChad
SecureChad is a simple encoder/decoder app made with plain HTML/CSS/JS.
This is one of the starting projects in my BILD-IT bootcamp that I've done with my colleague Adem Becirovic. The purpose of the project was to get to know what it's like to collaborate on a project, practice using Git/GitHub, and to write descriptive and clear commit messages.

## Features
    1. Encoding/Decoding

     Functionality to encode and decode the following ciphers:
     - Atbash Cipher
     - Caesar cipher
     - ROT13
     - Substitution Cipher
     - Vigenere Cipher
    
    2. Light/Dark Theme

     With one click, you can relieve your eyes of the painful agony called 'Light Theme'
     and enjoy your experience with the dark theme

    3. Copy to clipboard

     Each output has a clipboard button which copies your result with one click
     
## Run Locally

Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MujoBabajic/SecureChad.git
```

Open the project inside your text editor and simply start the live server for the index.html file. Or you can just double click on the index.html and it will open in your browser aswell.
